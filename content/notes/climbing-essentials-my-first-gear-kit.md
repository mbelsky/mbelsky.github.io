After a few weeks of climbing I realized that I cannot stop doing it. At this point I decided to buy my personal equipment.

I chose good staff in general. However some pieces didn't work well together. For example the carabiner and the belaying device.

I am not an experienced climber and I didn't have an experienced partner. So, instead of a tubular device I bought GriGri. In addition to being unexperienced I am also lazy. This is the reason why I bought Singing Rock Hector Triple with triple lock system that auto locks on closure. This feature allows you to skip one step of partner check.

But sometimes in the process of belaying I faced situations when GriGri moved to the side of the carabiner and got stuck there. As result it was not possible to easily move it back when a climber was sitting. So the carabiner was cross-loaded.

Because of that I decided to try Simond Rocky M Carabiner.

To be bought:

- anchor kit
- (?) belaying glasses
- helmet
- quickdraws
